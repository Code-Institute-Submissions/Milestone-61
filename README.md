## User Stories

* As a user I want a mobile friendly site so that I can browse quickly and easily.
* As a user I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.

## Structure

## Design
### The two main colours used are a violet #250967 and a light pink #CDBCCD as I felt these colours would suit a gym website,and also matched the images and fonts I chose. The violet and and light pink shade should compliment each other without being over powering to the eyes. Both colours were checked for contrast using the Webaim contrast checker.
