# User Experience Design

## Target Audience:
* Beginners to fitness
* Young Adults with busy lives
* Groups of friends 
* Students 

## User Stories
* As a user I want to see clearly where the gym is located and if there is parking available.
* As a user I want to see the gyms opening times during the week and at weekends.
* As a user I want to see what kinds of classes the gym has available.
* As a user I want a mobile friendly site so that I can browse quickly and easily.
* As a user I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.
* As a user I want to know what types of workout equipment that the gym has available.
* As a user I want to contact the gym so I can request more information.

## Structure

## Design
### Colour Scheme
* The two main colours used are a violet ![#250967](https://via.placeholder.com/15/250967/000000?text=+) and a light pink ![#CDBCCD](https://via.placeholder.com/15/CDBCCD/000000?text=+) as I felt these colours would suit a gym website,and also matched the images and fonts I chose. The violet and and light pink shade should compliment each other without being over powering to the eyes.
* I also wanted to use a darker brown ![#463730](https://via.placeholder.com/15/463730/000000?text=+) for the body, to make the purple shades pop.
* Both colours were checked for contrast using the Webaim contrast checker.

## Typography
* I used a mix of the font Teko, with Open Sans to create balance and structure throughout the website, which i feel pairs very well.
