# User Experience Design

## Target Audience:
* Beginners to fitness
* Young Adults with busy lives
* Groups of friends 
* Students 

## User Stories
* As a user I want to see clearly where the gym is located and if there is parking available.
* As a user I want to see the gyms opening times during the week and at weekends.
* As a user I want to see what kinds of classes the gym has available.
* As a user I want a mobile friendly site so that I can browse quickly and easily.
* As a user I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.
* As a user I want to know what types of workout equipment that the gym has available.
* As a user I want to contact the gym so I can request more information.

## Structure

## Design
### Colour Scheme
* The two main colours used are a violet ![#250967](https://via.placeholder.com/15/250967/000000?text=+) and a light pink ![#CDBCCD](https://via.placeholder.com/15/CDBCCD/000000?text=+) as I felt these colours would suit a gym website,and also matched the images and fonts I chose. The violet and and light pink shade should compliment each other without being over powering to the eyes.
* I also wanted to use a darker brown ![#463730](https://via.placeholder.com/15/463730/000000?text=+) for the body, to make the purple shades pop.
* Both colours were checked for contrast using the Webaim contrast checker.

## Typography
* I used a mix of the font Teko, with Open Sans to create balance and structure throughout the website, which i feel pairs very well.

## Differences between final design and original wireframes:
### Home page: 

Orginially I had planned to list my navigation menu horizontaly, but later decided to add a hamburger style nav bar from bootstrap and I found it was easier to navigate the menu items from mobile devices, was was much more pleasing to the eye. 
On all devices it was decided to have the first image act as a hero image for the page to grab the users attention, which I later decided to add a carousel feature to add more dimension.


# Features

## Existing Features

## Features Left to Implement

* [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) â€“ Used for creating the wireframes.
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - Git is used as version control software to commit and push code to the GitHub repository where the source code is stored.
* [GitHub](https://github.com/) - GithHub is the hosting site used to store the source code for the Website 
* [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) - Development environment where the site was built.
* [Webaim contrast checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) - Used to check the contrast between the various colours used.
* [Chrome Dev Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools) - Used throughout the development of the website to quickly see changes and find problems.

# Testing

## Code Validators
* CSS Stylesheet was run through the W3C CSS Validator and showed no errors.
* All HTML code was passed through the W3C Markup Validator, and showed a common error within the nav bar. <br>
![Error](assets/images/testing/w3-validator.png)<br>
* I reffered back to the original bootstrap nav bar code and decided to input a different button class. One that was the correct child element to give all pages a better hamburger menu.
* I ran the code again through W3C Markup Validator and it showed NO errors.

## Link Testing
* Navigation Menu links were all individually manually tested from each page of the website to ensure the user is directed to the correct page.
* Social Media links in the footer of each page were tested manually to ensure they direct the user to the correct page. As currently the business does not have any active social media sites these links point to the main page for each platform eg. facebook.com etc.
* Tested carousel controls left and right to ensure it moved smoothly and the captions also changed with the images.

## Form Testing
* Tested the submit button with no input fields filled in to ensure the form would not submit without the required fields filled in.
* Tested submitting the form without one of each of the required fields and the form will not submit without all required fields filled in.

## Testing User Stories
* As a user I want to see clearly where the gym is located and if there is parking available. - Text boxes are clearly stated to ensure Gym Information was displayed on the Home Page. <br>
* As a user I want to see the gyms opening times during the week and at weekends. -  Text Box is clearly defined to show the Gyms opening times for the weekdays and weekends. <br>
* As a user I want to see what kinds of classes the gym has available. - Testing was performed to ensure that all the types of classes are listed and fully responsive on all devices.<br>
* As a user I want a mobile friendly site so that I can browse quickly and easily. - This website was developed as a mobile first web site, ensuring mobile users an excellent user experience. <br>
* As a user I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content. - Testing was performed on all Navigation links to ensure users can easily navigate the Website. <br>
* As a user I want to know what types of workout equipment that the gym has available. - Full text box was tested to ensure it states all equipment and facilities available. <br>
* As a user I want to contact the gym so I can request more information. - Contact page is provided and is simple and easy to use. 

## Issues and Resolutions
* Nav bar issue on all pages. It was resolved by changing part of the code.
* Spelling mistakes were found when proof reading, these were corrected.
* Photo alignment issue on Classes page, this was fixed by adding bootstrap and using code from W3 website.
* Images on classes page were different sizes, these were fixed by adding height and width in css style.


# Deployment

## Project Creation
* This website was created in the Gitpod development environment. After installing the Gitpod extension for Chrome web browser and creating a new repository in GitHub using the Code Institute template,the green Gitpod button was used to initialise the repository in Gitpod. The following commands were used throughout the project, git add and git commit were used to store the work in the local Gitpod environment, git push would then be used to push the commits to the GitHub repository. From here the website could then deployed to Git Pages.

## Using Github Pages
* Navigate to the GitHub [Repository:](https://github.com/sophieboyle1/Milestone-1)
* Go to settings
* Scroll down to Git Hub Pages section
* Select 'Master Branch' as the source.
* Click Save
* Click on the link to go to the live deployed page.

## Run Local
